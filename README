test code to lock up ruby 1.8.7

To reproduce:

1) in one term start the server, 'ruby server.rb'

2) in another term start a client, 'ruby client.rb'

3) watch as you get back results from the server:
1
2
3
4

5) When the count reaches 5 the server will start writing a 400MB file to /var/tmp, open
   another terminal and start another client. 'ruby client.rb'  Note that you get no output
   but once the IO completes you will start getting return values.

6) You can start up as many clients as you want after it is done writing, you will get
   output on each
